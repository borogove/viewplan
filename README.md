## Viewplan

Viewplan is a Python script for generating telescope viewing plans for amateur astronomers. 

You specify the time and location for the viewing, and what sort of objects you're interested in; the program selects a list of viewable objects for the specified time and location, and generates a viewing plan with azimuth, altitude, and other information for each target. 

The output is sorted from West to East, so by visiting the targets in the given order you can avoid one setting while you're looking at another. 

### Dependencies

Viewplan requires the following third party Python packages:

* [PyEphem](http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/) - This does the heavy astronomical lifting.
* [parsedatetime](https://github.com/bear/parsedatetime) - This provides the handy natural language time parsing on the command line.    

Works on my machine with Python 2.7. 

### Examples

You're near Boston, you want to start watching right away, light pollution is making 
it impossible to see faint clusters, but you wouldn't mind seeing some bright double 
stars.  

~~~
: python viewplan.py --city Boston --start "in 15 minutes" 
        --planets --dsos --dsolimit 4 --stars --starlimit 1.8

Your viewing plan:
 viewing from 2015/6/7 05:45:26 (UTC)
 viewing from Boston
 including planets
 including interesting stars down to magnitude 1.8
 including nebulae and other DSOs down to magnitude 4.0
 limiting targets to altitudes between 20 and 70 degrees elevation

##### Location Options
The viewing location can be provided either with a city name such as `--city Boston` or a latitude/longitude/elevation coordinate set ("ICBM coordinates") such as `--lat 33:27:00 --lon -112:04:00 --elevation 331`.

The city name must be one of the (relatively few) cities in the PyEphem database. Latitude and longitude are given in "degrees:minutes:seconds" format (positive longitude east), and elevation in meters above sea level.  

If neither city nor coordinates are given, the script assumes you're viewing from my backyard in Oakland, CA.

##### Time Options

The viewing start time can be given in natural and relative language, e.g. `--start 9pm` or `--start "in 2 hours"` or `--start "tuesday 11pm"` (the quotation marks are required if there are spaces in the time description). Local time is assumed. 

##### Filter Options

You can request that planets, "interesting" stars, and other deep space objects (DSOs) such as galaxies, nebulae and clusters be listed, using the `--planets`, `--stars`, and `--dsos` options. If none of those three options are provided, planets and DSOs will be listed. 

By default, stars below magnitude 2.5 and DSOs below magnitude 5 are filtered out. The limiting magnitudes can be set, for instance including dimmer stars with `--starlimit 3.5` or keeping only the brightest DSOs with `--dsolimit 4.5`. 

Only targets whose altitude (elevation angle) are within a set range will be shown. This is handy if your local horizon is obscured by walls, trees, etc., or if your telescope mount isn't capable of elevating all the way to zenith. `--minalt 10` sets a floor 10 degrees above the horizon; `--maxalt 80` sets an upper limit of 80 degrees above the horizon. The defaults are 20 and 70 degrees. 

### Future Work

* Add an option to display RA and declination instead of altitude and azimuth.
* Add an option to display good candidate stars for alignment.
* Allow the user to specify what eyepiece focal lengths they have available.
* Sort the targets to reduce total scope slew distance while still working generally west-to-east, without going full Traveling Salesman.
* Add an end time option, allowing targets to be considered which are below the eastern horizon at the start of the plan.
